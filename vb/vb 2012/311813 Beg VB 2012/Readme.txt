There is no code for Chapter 2.
 

You should put the zip file into your documents library to avoid potential security issues and extract the contents.

To look at the example code, browse to the chapter folder and double click the solution file.  It will have the type "Microsoft Visual Studio Solution".

Remember that some chapter examples continue and the code here is the final example code.

Happy Coding!
